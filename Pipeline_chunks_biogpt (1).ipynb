Answer: Q: What are the genetic changes related to familial atrial fibrillation? A:. Additional risk factors for atrial fibrillation include high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes mellitus, a previous stroke, or an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Although most cases of atrial fibrillation are not known to run in families, studies suggest that they may arise partly from genetic risk factors. Researchers are working to determine which genetic changes may influence the risk of atrial fibrillation. Q: What is (are) familial hyperaldosteronism? A:. People with familial hyperaldosteronism may develop severe high blood pressure (hypertension), often early in life. Without treatment, hypertension increases the risk of strokes, heart attacks, and kidney failure.

You may need an emergency C-section because of a condition, such as a detached placenta, that puts you or your infant at risk. Q: A 27-year-old G2P2002 is recovering in the hospital on postpartum day 3 after a low transverse C-section. During morning rounds, she reports a “pus-like ” discharge and shaking chills overnight. She also endorses increased uterine cramping compared to the day before, but her postpartum course has otherwise been uneventful with a well-healing incision and normal vaginal bleeding. The patient ’ s prenatal care was complicated by HIV with a recent viral load of 400 copies / mL, type I diabetes well controlled on insulin, and a history of herpes simplex virus encephalitis in her first child. She did not have any genital lesions during the most recent pregnancy. Four days ago, she presented to the obstetric triage unit after spontaneous rupture of membranes and onset of labor. She made slow cervical change and reached full dilation after 16 hours, but there was limited fetal descent. Cephalopelvic disproportion was felt to be the reason for arrest of descent, so prophylactic ampillicin was administered and C-section was performed. A vaginal hand was required to dislodge the fetus ’ s head from the pelvis, and a healthy baby boy was delivered. On postpartum day 3, her temperature is 101.5 ° F (38.6 ° C), blood pressure is 119 / 82 mmHg, pulse is 100 / min, and respirations are 14 / min. Her incision looks clean and dry, there is mild suprapubic tenderness, and a foul yellow discharge tinged with blood is seen on her pad. Which of the following is the most significant risk factor for this patient ’ s presentation? A: C-section after onset of labor Q: Do you have information about Cesarean Section A: Summary: A Cesarean section (C-section) is surgery to deliver a baby.

            "Answer: According to the information available in the context and the knowledge you already have, answer the following question: How can we differentiate between an ischemic and a hemorrhagic stroke based on clinical presentation? Answer: Q: What is (are) Stroke? A: There are two kinds of stroke. The most common kind of stroke is called ischemic stroke. It accounts for approximately 80 percent of all strokes. An ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. The other kind of stroke is called hemorrhagic stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain. Q: What is (are) Stroke? A: Overview The two main types of stroke are ischemic (is-KE-mik) and hemorrhagic (hem-ah-RAJ-ik). Ischemic is the more common type of stroke. An ischemic stroke occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Blood clots often cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes. Q: What is (are) Hemorrhagic Stroke? A: A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic stroke is the less common type. It happens when a blood vessel breaks and bleeds into the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Causes include a bleeding aneurysm, an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), or an artery wall that breaks open. Q: What is (are) Stroke?

            "Answer: According to the information available in the context and the knowledge you already have, answer the following question: Can cold weather trigger breathing difficulties? Answer: Q: Do you have information about Climate Change A:. This can cause an increase in allergies, asthma, and breathing problems. - Mosquitoes and other insects that carry diseases spreading to areas that used to be too cold for them. - More floods and rising sea levels. This can cause an increase in contamination of food and water. - More extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and wildfires. These can cause death, injuries, stress, and mental health problems Q: What is (are) Hypothermia? A:. Anyone who spends much time outdoors in cold weather can get hypothermia. You can also get it from being cold and wet, or under cold water for too long. Babies and old people are especially at risk. Babies can get it from sleeping in a cold room. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Q: Do you have information about Winter Weather Emergencies A: Summary: Severe winter weather can lead to health and safety challenges. You may have to cope with - Cold related health problems, including frostbite and hypothermia - Household fires and carbon monoxide poisoning from space heaters and fireplaces - Unsafe driving conditions from icy roads - Power failures - Floods after snow and ice melt Although there are no guarantees of safety during winter weather emergencies, you can take actions to protect yourself and your family. < / FREETEXT > < / ABSTRACT > ▃\n",
