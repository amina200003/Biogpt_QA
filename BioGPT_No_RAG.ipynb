            " Answer:Question: Why do I sometimes feel my ear “pop ” without being on a plane? Answer: The ear is a complex organ that is sensitive to sound. The ear is composed of the tympanic membrane, ossicles, and the inner ear. The tympanic membrane is a thin membrane that covers the middle ear. The ossicles are bones that move the tympanic membrane. The inner ear is a complex organ that contains the cochlea, which is the sound-sensing part of the ear, and the vestibular system, which is the sense organ that detects head movements. The cochlea is a spiral of many turns. Each turn contains a different type of hair cell, which is the sensory cell of the ear. The inner ear is sensitive to sound waves. The sound waves are detected by the hair cells, which then send electrical signals to the brain. The vestibular system detects head movements. The signals are sent to the brain, which then controls the muscles that move the body. < / FREETEXT > < / PARAGRAPH > ▃ < PARAGRAPH > < FREETEXT > The ear is sensitive to sound waves.
