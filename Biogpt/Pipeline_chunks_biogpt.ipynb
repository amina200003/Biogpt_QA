            "Answer: Context: Q: What are the genetic changes related to familial atrial fibrillation? A:. Additional risk factors for atrial fibrillation include high blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes mellitus, a previous stroke, or an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries (atherosclerosis). Although most cases of atrial fibrillation are not known to run in families, studies suggest that they may arise partly from genetic risk factors. Researchers are working to determine which genetic changes may influence the risk of atrial fibrillation. Q: What is (are) familial hyperaldosteronism? A:. People with familial hyperaldosteronism may develop severe high blood pressure (hypertension), often early in life. Without treatment, hypertension increases the risk of strokes, heart attacks, and kidney failure. Familial hyperaldosteronism is categorized into three types, distinguished by their clinical features and genetic causes. In familial hyperaldosteronism type I, hypertension generally appears in childhood to early adulthood and can range from mild to severe Q: A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for a 1-week history of worsening shortness of breath. The symptoms occur when he climbs the stairs to his apartment on the 3rd floor and when he goes to bed. He gained 2.3 kg (5 lbs) in the past 5 days. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, alcoholic steatosis, and osteoarthritis. He received surgical repair of a ventricular septal defect when he was 4 months old. He started taking ibuprofen for his osteoarthritis and simvastatin for his hyperlipidemia one week ago. He drinks 2 – 3 beers daily after work. His temperature is 37.0 ° C (98.6 ° F), his pulse is 114 / min, and his blood pressure is 130 / 90 mmHg. Physical examination reveals jugular venous distention and 2 + pitting edema in his lower legs. On cardiac auscultation, an additional, late-diastolic heart sound is heard. Bilateral crackles are heard over the lung bases. Echocardiography shows concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle.

            "Answer: Context: Q: SPECT study with I-123-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) in patients with essential tremor. Is there any correlation with Parkinson's disease? A: Our results do not support the hypothesis of a link between essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. However, it appears that ET patients have a small degree of striatal dopaminergic degeneration. If this is due to alterations in the nigrostriatl pathway or of other origin it is not clear. Follow-up studies of essential tremor patients are warranted to assess progression of disease and to understand better the possible cause for striatal dopaminergic degeneration. Q: Is essential tremor inherited? A:. Essential tremor may also appear in people with no history of the disorder in their family. In some families, some individuals have essential tremor while others have other movement disorders, such as involuntary muscle tensing (dystonia). The potential genetic connection between essential tremor and other movement disorders is an active area of research. Q: Is Essential tremor inherited? A:.

Your baby also is at greater risk for RDS if you require an emergency cesarean delivery (C-section) before your baby is full term. You may need an emergency C-section because of a condition, such as a detached placenta, that puts you or your infant at risk. Q: A 27-year-old G2P2002 is recovering in the hospital on postpartum day 3 after a low transverse C-section. During morning rounds, she reports a “pus-like ” discharge and shaking chills overnight. She also endorses increased uterine cramping compared to the day before, but her postpartum course has otherwise been uneventful with a well-healing incision and normal vaginal bleeding. The patient ’ s prenatal care was complicated by HIV with a recent viral load of 400 copies / mL, type I diabetes well controlled on insulin, and a history of herpes simplex virus encephalitis in her first child. She did not have any genital lesions during the most recent pregnancy. Four days ago, she presented to the obstetric triage unit after spontaneous rupture of membranes and onset of labor. She made slow cervical change and reached full dilation after 16 hours, but there was limited fetal descent. Cephalopelvic disproportion was felt to be the reason for arrest of descent, so prophylactic ampillicin was administered and C-section was performed. A vaginal hand was required to dislodge the fetus ’ s head from the pelvis, and a healthy baby boy was delivered. On postpartum day 3, her temperature is 101.5 ° F (38.6 ° C), blood pressure is 119 / 82 mmHg, pulse is 100 / min, and respirations are 14 / min. Her incision looks clean and dry, there is mild suprapubic tenderness, and a foul yellow discharge tinged with blood is seen on her pad.

There are several types of meningitis. The most common is viral meningitis, which you get when a virus enters the body through the nose or mouth and travels to the brain. Bacterial meningitis is rare, but can be deadly. It usually starts with bacteria that cause a cold-like infection. It can block blood vessels in the brain and lead to stroke and brain damage Q: What is (are) Meningitis and Encephalitis? A: Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain itself.

            "Answer: Context: Q: What is (are) Stroke? A: There are two kinds of stroke. The most common kind of stroke is called ischemic stroke. It accounts for approximately 80 percent of all strokes. An ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. The other kind of stroke is called hemorrhagic stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain. Q: What is (are) Stroke? A: Overview The two main types of stroke are ischemic (is-KE-mik) and hemorrhagic (hem-ah-RAJ-ik). Ischemic is the more common type of stroke. An ischemic stroke occurs if an artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. Blood clots often cause the blockages that lead to ischemic strokes. Q: What is (are) Hemorrhagic Stroke? A: A stroke is a medical emergency. There are two types - ischemic and hemorrhagic. Hemorrhagic stroke is the less common type. It happens when a blood vessel breaks and bleeds into the brain. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Causes include a bleeding aneurysm, an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), or an artery wall that breaks open According to the information available in the context and the knowledge you already have, answer the following question: How can we differentiate between an ischemic and a hemorrhagic stroke based on clinical presentation? Answer: Hemorrhagic stroke is a medical emergency. It is caused by a blood vessel that breaks open. The blood clot that causes the stroke is blood in the brain. The clot blocks the blood vessel and stops the blood flow. The clot is not a blood clot. It is a blood vessel that has broken open. The clot is blood in the brain. The clot is not a blood clot.
