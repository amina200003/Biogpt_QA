Researchers are working to determine which genetic changes may influence the risk of atrial fibrillation. Q: What is (are) familial hyperaldosteronism? A:. People with familial hyperaldosteronism may develop severe high blood pressure (hypertension), often early in life. Without treatment, hypertension increases the risk of strokes, heart attacks, and kidney failure.

        "answer": "Context: Q: What is (are) Stroke? A: There are two kinds of stroke. The most common kind of stroke is called ischemic stroke. It accounts for approximately 80 percent of all strokes. An ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. The other kind of stroke is called hemorrhagic stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain. Q: What is (are) Stroke?
